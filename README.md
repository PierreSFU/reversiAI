First time coding Python was the Semester I built this AI, had to learn it myself so 
there are likely better methods to implement the same thing I did

The .pdf is a report of the informal format my Professor requested, the .XLSX excel sheet has the data I obtained from testing the AI and helps explain the reasoning for the heuristics I used and weighing assigned to each of them
